# Kubernetes Fundamentals
Hands on labs to guide you through the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes. We'll explore core components, deploy applications, and manage them to solidify your understanding

## Before we begin

Ensure you have basic familiarity with containers and Docker.
Choose a platform to run your Kubernetes cluster. Options include:
Docker Desktop (Windows and Mac)
Minikube (local single-node cluster)
Katacoda (interactive cloud environments)
Free cloud platforms with Kubernetes offerings (AWS EKS, GCP Kubernetes Engine, Azure AKS)

## Project Goals:

- Deploy a simple web application: We'll deploy a basic HTTP server to visualize cluster functionality.
- Work with Kubernetes objects: You'll define Pods, Deployments, and Services to manage application lifecycle.
- Explore services and scaling: We'll expose the application and learn how to scale it up and down.
- Understand logs and monitoring: You'll access application logs and utilize basic monitoring tools.
